        desc: "As my inaugural web development project, I chose to employ fundamental tools including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, mySql, and PHP. This endeavor served as a valuable test of my coding abilities, honed over the past two years. My goal was to see the project through from start to finish, encountering and addressing any challenges that arose during the development process. By doing so, I aimed to gain insight into which aspects proved most problematic, allowing me to avoid similar issues in future projects."

Through my first project, I came to the realization that in order to write cleaner and more maintainable code, I needed to incorporate some JavaScript and CSS frameworks. After exploring Angular and Vue, I ultimately decided to work with ReactJS for this particular project. Additionally, SASS proved to be a major game changer and I doubt that I will ever go back to writing pure CSS again. As for the backend and database support, I utilized PHP and mySQL, but I have experimented with NodeJS and may consider using it in the future. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of my current hosting provider, I am unable to install NodeJS on their shared hosting service option. While I have set up my own server for testing, I am not yet prepared to deal with any reliability issues at my current stage of personal development. Therefore, I have made the decision to delay the use of NodeJS for backend development at this time."

The website will allow clients to request quotes and order services online. To expedite the development process and reduce production costs, I have chosen to utilize tools such as W3.CSS (a substitute for bootstrap) and jQuery. Additionally, I plan to transition from using PHP on the back end to NodeJS. Furthermore, the application will possess the capability to collect data about website traffic and deliver reports to the client."
