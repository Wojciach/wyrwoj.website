This endeavor served as a valuable test of my coding abilities, honed over the past two years. My goal was to see the project through from start to finish, encountering and addressing any challenges that arose during the development process. By doing so, I aimed to gain insight into which aspects proved most problematic, allowing me to avoid similar issues in future projects."

        desc: "This digital CV that you're currently viewing is actually my second project. Through my first project, I came to the realization that in order to write cleaner and more maintainable code, I needed to incorporate some JavaScript and CSS frameworks. After exploring Angular and Vue, I ultimately decided to work with ReactJS for this particular project. Additionally, SASS proved to be a major game changer and I doubt that I will ever go back to writing pure CSS again. As for the backend and database support, I utilized PHP and mySQL, but I have experimented with NodeJS and may consider using it in the future. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of my current hosting provider, I am unable to install NodeJS on their shared hosting service option. While I have set up my own server for testing, I am not yet prepared to deal with any reliability issues at my current stage of personal development. Therefore, I have made the decision to delay the use of NodeJS for backend development at this time."

This project allowed me to refine my React skills, correct coding habits, and improve the integration between PHP back-end and React front-end. Focusing on OOP in PHP made the server-side more versatile for potential use in future projects. The result is a polished and scalable website, demonstrating my commitment to continuous improvement and technical excellence."
