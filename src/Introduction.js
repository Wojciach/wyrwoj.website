            <h2>WHAT DRIVES ME</h2>
            <p>
            As a fresh Full Stack Web Developer, I am extremely eager to learn new skills and continuously improve upon the ones I already have. My passion for web development drives me to seek out new challenges and opportunities for growth. I am seeking to join a team that will guide me further into the industry and provide me with the support I need to excel. However, I am also a self-reliant individual who is confident in my ability to solve problems independently and effectively. With my strong problem-solving skills, drive to succeed, and passion for web development, I am confident that I will make a valuable addition to any team.
